Assignment 3:

 

Consider a monolithic java application stack.

Apache Web Server, Apache Tomcat application server with Active MQ and Oracle and MongoDB backend.

 

Propose a solution to migrate this application stack to cloud of your choice (AWS/OpenStack/Azure).

Mention all the provider services you would use and how you would maintain HA and Load Balancing (consider app to be stateless). Mention rationale for each decision.

-------------------------
answers steps refer the diagram in code 4 

 
I would prefer Openstack to migrate and will follow below steps.


1) I will spawn VM's in cluster for each application. Please find below diagram for the same.


2) Install the respective packages into the VM's.


3) Will copy the document root for Apache via winscp/scp.


4) Also will copy the configuration for each component.


5) I will use proxy or mod_jk modules for apache tomcat integration and load balancing.
